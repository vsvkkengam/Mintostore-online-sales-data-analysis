# Power Bi - Mintostore sales - Data Analysis
The dashboard I created is based on the data set that was found on the internet and I modified the dataset for my convenience and used it for this project. I had the extraordinary opportunity to grasp the topics from level zero to advanced. It did take a fair amount of time and several rounds of revision to absorb the extensive content that was presented and simultaneously generate visuals that are intuitive, detailed, and comprehensible.

In this project, I have done:
* Formatting, cleaning, transforming and standardisation of the data using Power query editor.

* Application of merge queries and append
queries to make dataset meaningful and
connecting multiple datasets.

* DAX language for custom calculations.

* Efficient use of slicers and filters, and different inbuilt functions to get meaningful insights.

* Understanding and application of different types of visuals.

* Reporting and design principles to create impactful reports.

* this report comprises the sales analysis, cost analysis, profit analysis by various sub-categories and by customer demogrpahies.
